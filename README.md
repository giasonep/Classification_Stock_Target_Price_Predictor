# Stock Target Price Predictor
Metis Classification Module 4 Project

### ABSTRACT

I developed a classification pipeline that takes in a stockâ€™s price data from the TD Ameritrade API, transforms the data using a series of custom functions and evaluates that stock relative to a trading system known as The Strat. The classification problem is: what is the probability that a stock will hit its target price using The Strat trading system? I trained the data on five models to find the model that best predicts on the test data. The model with the best performance was a tuned Random Forest, which predicted with a .74 accuracy on the test data. I then used this model to predict stock performance for the month of September, which returned a .80 accuracy score and 80% success rate on the top five stocks with the highest probability of success.
